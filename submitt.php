                    <p>One of Perez-Reverte’s strangest stories. Book dealer Lucas Corso embarks on a mission to find a lost book, printed in Venice in the 16th century. But this book contains engravings that, following a certain ritual can, summon the devil.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-2">Lila,Lila BY Martin suter</h4>
                    <p>A shy young man finds a dead man’s manuscript hidden in a cabinet in a market, and decides to pass it off as his own to impress the woman he loves. The novel is published and brings him huge success, but he is of course unable to write a second one. And then threatening letters start to arrive – from someone claiming to be the author.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-3">A Ladder To The Sky By John Boyne</h4>
                    <p>In a hotel in Berlin, the young Maurice Swift happens to run into the famous novelist Erich Ackerman, who confides in him about his dark past. The unscrupulous Swift quickly appropriates Ackerman’s life story – ruining him, but finally becoming the famous author he’s always dreamed of being. Years later, Swift needs new sources of inspiration … It doesn’t matter whose stories they are, or how he acquires them, so long as they continue to make his name. These stories will drive him to lie, steal and maybe even worse.</p>
